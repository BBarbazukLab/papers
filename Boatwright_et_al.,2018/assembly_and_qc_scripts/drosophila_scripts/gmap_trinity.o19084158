Note: >1 sequence detected, so index files are being memory mapped.
  GMAP can run slowly at first while the computer starts to accumulate
  pages from the hard disk into its cache.  To copy index files into RAM
  instead of memory mapping, use -B 3, -B 4, or -B 5, if you have enough RAM.
  For more speed, also try multiple threads (-t <int>), if you have multiple processors or cores.
